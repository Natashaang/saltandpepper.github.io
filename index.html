        <h3>The 20 Best Wine Bars In Melbourne, 2023 Edition</h3>

            What defines a wine bar? Waiters that know their Semillons from their Sauvignons are a good start. And of course you need a comprehensive selection, not just from the big players (your Napa’s, Bordeaux’s and Barossa’s) but well travelled bottles from up-and-coming vintners in Macedonia, South Africa, even Chile. We reckon atmosphere plays a big part too. It can't be considered one of Melbourne's best wine bars without at least one piece of furniture upholstered in clichéd maroon leather, soft lighting and a sommelier that'll make you feel like you're all of a sudden an expert on the ol' plonk.
